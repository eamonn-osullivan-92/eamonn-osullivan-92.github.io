    <h3 class="question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

    <p class="answer">
        That I can sometimes show both a fixed mindset and a growth mindset towards problems and challenges. 
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Learning about emotional intelligence and how it affects me in my personal and professional life
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        That I maybe didn’t understand it at all (well not as much as I thought) until I put my thoughts on paper
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
        Values define who you are, and the type of person you want to be (just like in javascript right?). Some things that I value are kindness, creativity, growth and authenticity. In learning and programming, kindness relates to how I interact with my peers. Creativity allows me to solve technical problems, and keep a broad perspective of my environment. Growth keeps me hungry to learn and better myself. Authenticity is my desire to be true to myself and everything I value. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
        Empathy relates to how you view others, and how you view yourself, particularly when times get tough. Being empathetic to your own struggles or situation will help push through to something more positive with an open mind. Showing empathy to your peers as they deal with their own struggles and issues will not only help them as an individual, but both of you as a collective entity. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
        Self-awareness allows us to take an objective look at ourselves and understand what we can do to improve. This helps us be more receptive to feedback and advice from others. Nobody is a master of everything, we all have our own strengths and limitations, so leaning on others to improve on skills we lack, and helping others in areas we feel more comfortable is an important part of learning and programming as a team. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">
        What has surprised you the most about core learning?
    </h3>
      <p class="answer">I’ve always struggled to talk about this sort of stuff in the past, and I think I still do a bit in a verbal sense. But I’ve actually found it surprisingly easy voicing my thoughts and feelings through the blog posts. It has been good to finally commit words to paper and think about things that I have probably ignored or neglected in the past. </p>


    <h3 class="question">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
        It’s hard to say what was the most challenging aspect, but I think it’s always a bit difficult to be critical of yourself. I think sometimes I can be in denial about some of my limitations and avoid giving them any thought. Doing this gives you a sense that it’s not a big issue, but in reality this only makes the issue worse. 
    </p>



    <h3 class="question">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
        The most obvious reason I think is to help students succeed in a team or peer to peer work environment. Being comfortable with who you are, and having the emotional intelligence to be empathetic and understanding of your peers is essential to work efficiently and happily in a team environment. 
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Another reason is that the programming industry is constantly evolving, so a lot of onus falls on the individual to keep improving and learning as they progress through their careers. To truly succeed and enjoy a career in programming you will need to be committed to self-reflection and self-improvement and having a solid understanding of your values, identity, strengths and limitations will help you become the best version of yourself.
    </p>


    <h3 class="question">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
        Definitely not. I have worked in a professional environment for the last five years and can see the importance core human skills have in your ability to perform a job well, particularly as part of a team (which is most jobs these days). Having these skills I think makes you more accountable to yourself, which lets you constantly push yourself to be a better person, not only for the benefit of yourself but everyone you associate yourself with.

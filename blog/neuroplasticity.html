    <h3 class="question">
     Neuroplasticity
          </h3>

    <p class="answer">
      I am sure you are familiar with the old saying; “you can't teach an old dog new tricks”. Just the other week I noticed my mum still buys the TV guide magazine despite all that information being easily accessible online, for free. I know the saying is not meant to be taken literally, as it comes from a stubbornness to change rather than ability. But next time your parents call you to come over and fix the computer let them know that they too, with the power of neuroplasticity, can learn how to do this themselves. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to grow and adapt as the environments and experiences we go through change. The human brain has approximately 100 billion neurons, which can be considered as the building blocks of the brain. These neurons are responsible for detecting what goes on around us and deciding how we should react. It is our neurons that give us our personality and consciousness. 
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      Neuroplasticity works by strengthening the connections between frequently used neurons, and weakening or eliminating neurons that become neglected, and this process is constantly happening as we gain new experiences or knowledge. Understanding this is what has allowed us to evolve and learn new skills. This is a fascinating notion that essentially means we are never a finished product, and with practice we can achieve anything we set our minds to. 
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      Reflecting on my current experience as I work through the Dev Academy programme, consistency is a big focus of mine. Being consistent with my study schedule and making time to code (almost) every day lets me strengthen the neurons that help me become a better programmer and problem solver. But neuroplasticity extends far further than any academic setting. I am currently re-learning how to skate after a 5 year or so hiatus, and I can feel the neurons that were once strong, slowly start to strengthen themselves again with practice.

      While I was researching the topic, I found a blog post by <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/neuroplasticity-train-your-brain" target="_blank">Atlassian</a> that touched on the subject and provided ways we can boost our neuroplasticity and 'rewire our cognitive pathways'. I have listed some that i intend to apply while i am studying: 
    </p>

    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>Feed your brain - a healthy diet high in vitamins and energy is essential for promoting neuroplasticity. </li>
      <li>Don't let the work day linger - Similar to building muscle, the brain needs downtime to do its work. Take breaks and don't work the brain too hard.</li>
      <li>Expand your vocabulary - learning to code is essentially learning a new language, so this technique is being used daily. However, even writing these blogs, I am looking to expand my English vocabulary (AKA google search synonym).</li>
      <li>Be mindful, as a team - Mindfulness is something that Dev Academy has introduced to me, and I am learning the ways of meditation by myself before the Bootcamp group sessions begin. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="question">
The Growth Mindset
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
      The Growth Mindset, coined by psychologist Carol Dweck is intertwined with neuroplasticity.  Where neuroplasticity refers to our ability to adapt and change, the Growth Mindset, and its counterpart the Fixed Mindset, relate to our desire or attitude towards change. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      Someone with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence or abilities are fixed and can't be taught. They believe that their abilities are innate. A growth mindset believes that skills and intelligence can be developed over time. These two mindsets have significantly different approaches to skills or problems that they may face in life. A diagram I found on the <a href="https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset" target="_blank">mindsetheath</a> website illustrates this below. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">Now i'll be honest, i hadn't heard of the Growth Mindset prior to my exploration at the beginning of Spring 4. But looking at it now through the lens of my past experiences, I don't think we are limited to one mindset. There have been times I have approached a task with a fixed mindset, I gave up on guitar pretty quickly for example. But there have been plenty of times I have shown a growth mindset too. Teaching myself to code is a good example of this, while frustrating at times, each bump in the road only made me more determined and eager to learn. What shapes this mindset I don't know - but knowing what I know now, I will certainly be making a conscious effort to be more open and receptive to growth in all tasks I apply myself to. The sky's the limit and with the right mindset, old dogs can learn new tricks. </p>

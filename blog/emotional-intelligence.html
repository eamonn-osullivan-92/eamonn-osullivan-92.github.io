    <h3 class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

    <p class="answer">
      Emotional intelligence at its core definition refers to the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions. This relates to one's own emotions, and one’s understanding of the emotions of others.
      According to a study by Psychologists Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer, there are 4 different levels of emotional intelligence:

    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>Percieving Emotions</li>
      <li>Reasoning with Emotions</li>
      <li>Understanding Emotions</li>
      <li>Managing Emotions</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="content-subheading">
      1) Perceiving emotions
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
      It is important that you perceive emotions accurately to properly understand what you or others are feeling. This perception can come from verbal signals or non-verbal signals. An example of a verbal signal could be someone at work who is speaking very frantically about their workload would indicate that they are feeling overwhelmed or stressed. On the flipside of this, some people might go completely quiet and introverted if they are feeling stressed. Understanding how different people and personalities react in these situations is a key part of emotional intelligence and what makes it difficult for many to understand. Another example would be someone who is being short and unwelcoming in their responses might indicate that the person is upset or has something external occupying their mind and taking them away from the present situation. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      Non-verbal cues on the other hand are generally more difficult to perceive. Non-verbal cues come in the form of body language and facial expressions. For both verbal and non-verbal signals, it is essential to understand the personalities of others, as this will help you pick up on changes in behavior and understand the different reactions to emotions.
    </p>

    <h4 class="content-subheading">
      2) Reasoning with emotions:
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
      How we reason with emotions is a big factor in how we react to a particular feeling. Sometimes our emotions can overwhelm our thought processes, which can give us a warped view on certain situations. For example, I could have a productive week working through Sprint - 3, sticking to my schedule and learning commitments. However on Friday, I am just not quite feeling right and I hit a wall. The progress I had made learning javascript earlier in the week seems obsolete and I become frustrated with my current situation. In this scenario I would be letting my current issue overwhelm my thoughts and take away from the progress I had made earlier. When approached with an issue like this, rather than ignoring the emotions, it is essential that we learn how to reason with them. This will enable us to approach the problem in a more logical and productive manner.
    </p>

    <h4 class="content-subheading">
3) Understanding emotions:  
    </h4>
      <p class="answer">Having the ability to understand the emotions one perceives is a key part of emotional intelligence. Oftentimes one's initial perception of an emotion, or the cause of that emotion can be misguided. If a colleague is showing signs of stress at work might mean that it is related to their workload, however it could just as likely be caused by issues at home or outside of the workplace. Taking the time to reflect on the perceived emotions and dissect the potential causes will help you understand the right way to approach the issue. This can be internally, how you understand and approach emotions that you are feeling yourself, or externally, how you understand the emotions of others. Taking the time to chat and listen to others to get an insight into their thoughts and perspective is an essential part of this. </p>


    <h4 class="content-subheading">
      4) Managing emotions: 
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
      Managing emotions in an empathetic manner is one of the most crucial aspects of emotional intelligence. Managing emotions means taking the information gathered from our perception, reasoning and understanding of an emotion and taking steps to respond appropriately. While being empathetic to others situations is important, self-empathy can often be overlooked. Humans by nature tend to be more critical of themselves than others, so treating yourself with kindness in these situations is important.

    <h3 class="question">
      How is it different from IQ?
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
      IQ, Intelligence Quotient is a measure of analytical and numerical intelligence. This refers to a person's logic, reasoning, analytical and problem solving abilities, whereas EQ, or emotional intelligence, measures a person's ability to understand themselves and others on an emotional level. 
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      In the past IQ has always been the gold standard to measure a person's intelligence, however more recently there has been an emphasis on EQ and how it can be used (in conjunction with IQ) as an overall measure of one's intelligence. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">
      Why is it important?
    </h3>

    <p class="answer">
      Emotional intelligence is important as life is a collaborative event where we are constantly communicating and working with others. Society today requires the use of emotional intelligence to make positive connections and strong relationships with others. Because of this collaborative nature, we are seeing a big shift in what is considered more important, IQ or EQ. I don’t think that either one is more important than the other, they are both a piece of the same pie that defines us as human beings. Both should be a focus if we want to become the most productive version of ourselves.

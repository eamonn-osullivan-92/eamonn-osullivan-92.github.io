    <h2 class="content-heading">Bootcamp</h2>
    <h3 class="question">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway.</h3>

    <p class="secondary-question content-subheading">What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</p>

    <p class="answer">
        I mentioned in my Foundations learning plan that I am hoping to get into the UX/UI side of Web Development. Gaining some skills in design and understanding user interactions is something I intend to pursue after the course, be it in my own time, or from supplementary courses. What I hope to gain from the Bootcamp is the hard Web Development skills to be able to implement my own creative ideas into production, and the soft skills to thrive in employment. I have lots of friends who work in marketing, E-commerce, graphic design etc. and I would love to be able to collaborate on projects and campaigns. Being able to use my previous experience from product focused roles and have an input on strategy and design is what I hope to achieve in the long run. Gotta pay my dues first though, and I am looking forward to the process. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="question">
        2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
    </h4>

    <p class="secondary-question">
        Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
        I'm not sure if I have discovered any new ones, but I have been putting a big emphasis on improving on my limitations. As I am writing this I am about to jump into some pair programming to tackle the minesweeper stretch challenge. I have also been trying to lend a hand to others on discord as much as possible, and have helped a few students out over a video call. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
        I think putting your limitations into writing means that you have accepted that you need to work on something, and have brought it up because it's something you want to improve, so there's nothing left to do but try and get better. This is the attitude that I am embracing as I enter the Bootcamp.
    </p>

    <h4 class="question">
        3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
    </h4>

    <p class="secondary-question content-subheading">
        While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.
    </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Speaking in front of the group is the first one that springs to mind, I have never been a confident public speaker. I can articulate my thoughts quite well in writing, but verbally has always been a bit more of a challenge. I think my mind tends to run wild a bit so I need to learn to slow things down. 
      </p>


    <h4 class="question">
        4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h4>

    <p class="secondary-question content-subheading">
        At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?

        For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
    <ul class="ordered-list">
        <li class="list-item">Communication - however i think this is fine in a pair setting, it is group settings that I struggle with</li>
        <li class="list-item">Improving self-awareness and articulating my thoughts and feelings</li>
        <li class="list-item">Leadership skills</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="question">
       5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
    </h4>

    <p class="secondary-question content-subheading">
        What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.  
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        Similar to my response for Foundations, I want the facilitators to recognize my potential and push me to be the best I can be. This applies to both the tech and core components of the course. Being upfront and providing guidance on areas I can improve or could be doing better will help me achieve this.
    </p>
    

    <h4 class="question">
       6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
    </h4>

    <p class="secondary-question content-subheading">
        What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.  
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        For the most part, I will seek help from the facilitators. They know the course best, and are there to help guide us through the course. Seeking help from my peers is also something to consider, but it is important to be mindful of the position others are in. The Bootcamp workload is very intensive, so a lot of thought will need to be put into how others are handling themselves and if they are in the right frame of mind to provide assistance. On the flipside of this, it also provides an opportunity for me to provide assistance if I feel comfortable doing so. 
    </p>


    <p class="answer">
        When the pair and group programming begins, checking in with your group to see how they are feeling towards the projects, the group structure, the bootcamp and just life in general is also important. Opening up a safe space to air out any thoughts and feelings is essential to keep spirits high and the work flowing.
    </p>


    <h2 class="content-heading">Foundations</h2>
    <h3 class="question">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway.</h3>

    <p class="answer">
      I think I will be happy with any Junior Web Development role to begin with, as long as there's plenty of opportunity for growth and/or mentorship. Long term however, I would love to get into the UX/UI side of Web Development, and will definitely be looking into courses that can help me expand on these skills. I like the visual side of Web Development, creating something that looks good and feels good to use. It would be great to work at an agency where I could have some creative and strategic input, as well as being a Web Developer. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="question">
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
      I think I have a fairly calm and logical approach to learning, which helps me not get bogged down and frustrated. Having completed secondary and tertiary education, and been thrown into the deep end in multiple jobs, I have a lot of experience in learning and an understanding of what works best for me. I can learn on the fly, and know my way around a google search when required. Prior to applying for Dev Academy, I had been self-teaching for 8 months or so which has been great to hone my learning patterns and strategies in a Web Development environment. Another strength I have is humility, which means I am open to criticism and opinions, and I don't mind being told I'm incorrect.
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      My limitations stem from being independent in nature. I think I sometimes hold myself back by trying to figure something out myself rather than seeking help from others. This slightly contradicts the logical approach to learning I mentioned as a strength (haha), but it is something I am aware of and actively trying to improve. IT is an industry that is dominated by collaborative work, so it is important that I improve my communication skills and be more outgoing and outspoken in learning and professional environments. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="question">
      3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy.
    </h4>
      <p class="answer">I would like to become more outspoken and a better leader. I often have thoughts and ideas that I think are worth sharing, but when it comes to articulating these I often stumble and struggle to get my point across in a clear way. 
      </p>


    <h4 class="question">
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
The Dev Academy programme is a short, but intensive experience, so I will be putting all my energy into the course to ensure I get the most out of it. I have been working in a 8:30/9am - 5pm job for the past 5 years, and I am used to the routine of working through these hours. This is where I aim to get the bulk of my work done, as I find I am far more productive through the mornings/day rather than the evenings. However I understand I will be required to put in additional hours outside of this and into the weekends, and I am happy to do so. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      However I am also aware that a healthy work/lifestyle balance is a key factor in performance. It's important not to get too burnt out, as this will cause my productivity to drop. To achieve this balance, I am hoping to find time for exercise or chill during lunch breaks, and evenings where I can fit it into the workload. This can be in the form of going to the gym, heading to the skatepark, or just catching up with friends to chat and take my mind away from coding. This will keep me fresh and help me stay productive and engaged when it is learning time. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      I am looking forward to the group work aspect of the bootcamp where I will have the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with other students. However I am well aware that this comes with responsibility. Discussing workloads, schedules, strengths and limitations with team members will be essential to find a balance that will ensure the team is productive as a unit. This will mean adjusting my own schedule to meet the requirements of others, learning about where teammates are struggling and lending a hand, and being open to opinions and feedback in areas where I might be struggling (and in general). I will also be leaning on the facilitators for guidance and open to their feedback during the course.  They know the course inside/out and will have an understanding of the common pitfalls or tendencies that might cause students to struggle. 
    </p>

    <p class="answer">
      When things start to build up and get to me, I will firstly look to take a break. Sometimes a clear mind is all that is required to get you back on track. If I am still struggling, I will seek support and guidance from other students and facilitators. Given the short and intensive nature of this course, it is important to not get bogged down for too long as it could start to snowball as the course moves on. 
    </p>
    

    <h4 class="question">
     5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
      If I am stuck and in need of help, I will seek help from other students (provided they are available). This will be via Discord for Foundations, but once the Bootcamp starts it can be through conversation. We are all working through the same content so we are likely to run into similar problems. If they are not able to help right away, we might be able to find a solution together. Speaking from personal experience, I also think having the opportunity to help someone with a problem is a great learning experience for both the teacher and the student, and helps both parties become more familiar with the content.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The facilitators are also always on hand to help, so if I find I am stuck on a problem for too long I will see if they can point me in the right direction. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="question">
     6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
      Just to push me as hard as possible so I can get the most out of the course. Feedback and communication on what I am doing well, where I can improve, what you think I can do better. I won't be offended if someone lets me know I am not working to my potential, but hopefully that doesn't have to happen.
    </p>

    <h4 class="question">
     7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h4>

    <p class="answer">
      I have completely cleared my schedule for the duration of the course, so i don't have any other commitments apart from my brother's wedding on the 26th of August. This is in Australia, so it would require me missing a half day on the 25th of August, and i would need to work remotely on the 25th of August (Wedding doesn't start till 5pm NZ time on the Friday. I understand that the structure of the bootcamp doesn't allow much flexibility on missed time, but I would be committed to making up for any missed content in my own time. However if this will be an issue please let me know as Dev Academy is my main priority, and I wouldn't want to let anyone down if there is some group work scheduled.

        <h3 class="question">1. Describe your core personal values.</h3>
        <h4 class="question">
          Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
          decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
        </h4>

        <p class="answer">
          Prior to leaving my previous job in the Travel Industry, the company
          was going through a rough time with a lot of staff turnover. While
          things were certainly starting to improve, there weren't a lot of
          staff who knew how the business worked outside of a COVID environment.
          I knew that leaving would put the company, and particularly my
          manager, in a tough spot as I was the only one left who knew how parts
          of the business functioned. Surviving the COVID period in the travel
          industry meant that everyone had to 'wear many hats' and take on
          multiple roles, so I knew that there wasn;'t anyone at the company that
          could comfortably take on my role.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          I was grateful for the support and belief the company had shown in me
          during my employment, so I decided to be upfront about my decision to
          leave the company as soon as I had made the decision (approx. 6 months
          before I was due to move back to New Zealand). I did this because I
          knew that there would need to be new staff hired, trained and I was
          one of the few that could do it.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          I have always been quite an independent worker. I like to have a well
          defined role that I can execute on my own, so the training and
          leadership role I took on was definitely out of my comfort zone. The
          extra workload that came with it was also a factor, as I was already
          feeling the heat with my current role, but I am thankful I committed
          to it. It was a great growth opportunity for me, and it was reassuring
          to be able to provide knowledge and expertise to newer staff members.
          It definitely helped give me confidence in my own abilities, possibly
          more than I had previously given myself credit for.

        <p class="answer">
          A natural curiosity to want to understand how things work: <br />
          Since beginning to learn programming, this curiosity has helped me a
          lot. Oftentimes I have been stuck on a particular problem or obstacle,
          and through extensive google searching or trial and error you find a
          way to make it work. But this doesn't necessarily mean you fully
          understand the concept or issue that you were faced with, so I will
          always dig deeper and find out the why's and how's of the problem. How
          did the problem arise in the first place? What is the solution
          actually doing in the grand scheme? Could the problem be avoided (is
          the solution necessary). These sorts of critical questions have helped
          me immensely since beginning to program, and in other learning
          environments.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          In the context of my learning obsticles, being more comfortable with a
          particular concept or topic helps overcome any confidence issues i
          might have, making me a more outspoken and outgoing participant in a
          learning or professional environment.

        <h4 class="question">
          Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
          productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
          the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and
          your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>

        <p class="answer">
          A previous job of mine was to stress test and audit travel packages
          that would be submitted by colleagues. A lot of this involved
          providing suggestions on how a travel package could be improved, be it
          price related or product related. The colleagues that created the
          travel packages were not always as welcoming and open to criticism as
          you would like (speaking from personal experience, as I have worked in
          both roles), so there was often resistance and tension.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          I found it was always important to get a deeper understanding of where
          the tensions were coming from. Do they not agree with my criticisms or
          suggestions? Or is it the stress of deadlines and workload that is
          making them uncomfortable with making late changes. I would always
          make sure to break down my criticisms from the perspective of a
          customer, and how it might affect either their experience, or their
          desire to purchase the product. Another strategy was to not just say
          what I thought was wrong, but what I think would be better. Even
          providing a few different options that I thought would improve the
          product and opening a discussion to find something we both agree on.
          This would speed up the process for the product creator to confirm any
          changes with their overseas partners and ease the workload for all
          involved.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          For now and the future, I'm going to focus on making a real effort to
          understand the person. Problems generally arise from a clash of
          personalities, not opinions. I don’t consider myself too proud or
          anything, I know I'm not always right. The best solution is one that
          both parties agree on, so understanding who the other party is, what
          their values are, and why they feel the way they do will go a long way
          to creating a better work environment.
